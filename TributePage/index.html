                <h3>Who Was Michael Jackson?</h3>
                <h6>BIOGRAPHY</h6>
                <p>Michael Jackson was a multi-talented musical entertainer who enjoyed a chart-topping career both with
                    the Jackson 5 and as a solo artist. He released one of the best-selling albums in history,
                    'Thriller,' in 1982, and had other number-one hits on 'Bad' and 'Off the Wall.'</p>
                <P>Known as the "King of Pop," Michael Joseph Jackson was a best-selling American singer, songwriter and
                    dancer. As a child, Jackson became the lead singer of his family's popular Motown group, the Jackson
                    5. He went on to a solo career of astonishing worldwide success, delivering No. 1 hits from the
                    albums Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad. In his later years, Jackson was dogged by allegations of
                    child molestation. He died in 2009 at age 50 of a drug overdose just before launching a comeback
                    tour.</P>
