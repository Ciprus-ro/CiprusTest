<section class="main-section" id="Sass_Instalattion"><header>Sass Instalattion</header>
<p> Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a CSS pre-processor can help. Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff.</p>
<h3>What is Sass?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet</li>
    <li>Sass is an extension to CSS</li>
    <li>Sass is a CSS pre-processor</li>
    <li>Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS</li>
    <li>Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time</li>
    <li>Sass was designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006</li>
    <li>Sass is free to download and use</li>
</ul>
<p>Read more about Sass at the official Sass web site: <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" alt="Official site for Sass" target="_blank"> </a> </p>
<p>System Requirements for Sass</p>
<ul>
  <li>Operating system - Sass is platform independent</li>
  <li>Browser support - Sass works in Edge/IE (from IE 8), Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera</li>
  <li>Programming language - Sass is based on Ruby</li>
</ul>

</section>

?Section 2 
======== -->
<section class="main-section" id="Sass_Variables"><header>Sass Variables</header>
    <p>With Sass, you can store information in variables, like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>strings</li>
        <li>numbers</li>
        <li>colors</li>
        <li>booleans</li>
        <li>lists</li>
        <li>nulls</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sass uses the $ symbol, followed by a name, to declare variables:</p>
    <code>$variablename: value;</code>
</section>

<!-- ===========
?Section 3 
======== -->

<section class="main-section" id="Sass_Nested"><header>Sass Nested</header>
    <p>Many CSS properties have the same prefix, like font-family, font-size and font-weight or text-align, text-transform and text-overflow. </p>

    <code>font: {
        family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
        size: 18px;
        weight: bold;
      }
      
      text: {
        align: center;
        transform: lowercase;
        overflow: hidden;
      }</code>

      <code>font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
        font-size: 18px;
        font-weight: bold;
        
        text-align: center;
        text-transform: lowercase;
        text-overflow: hidden;</code>
    <p>Sass lets you nest CSS selectors in the same way as HTML. Look at an example of some Sass code for a site's navigation: </p>

    <code>nav {
        ul {
          margin: 0;
          padding: 0;
          list-style: none;
        }
        li {
          display: inline-block;
        }
        a {
          display: block;
          padding: 6px 12px;
          text-decoration: none;
        }
      }</code>
</section>

<!-- ===========
?Section 4 
======== -->
<section class="main-section" id="Sass_@mixin_and_@include"><header>Sass @mixin and @include</header>
<P>The @mixin directive lets you create CSS code that is to be reused throughout the website. The @include directive is created to let you use (include) the mixin.</P>
<p>A mixin is defined with the @mixin directive.</p>

<code>@mixin name {
    property: value;
    property: value;
    ...
  }</code>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> A tip on hyphens and underscore in Sass: Hyphens and underscores are considered to be the same. This means that @mixin important-text { } and @mixin important_text { } are considered as the same mixin!</p>
</section>

<!-- ===========
?Section 5 
======== -->
<section class="main-section" id="Sass_@import_and_Partials"><header>Sass @import and Partials</header>
<p>Sass keeps the CSS code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). One way to write DRY code is to keep related code in separate files.</p>
<p>Just like CSS, Sass also supports the @import directive. The @import directive allows you to include the content of one file in another. The CSS @import directive has a major drawback due to performance issues; it creates an extra HTTP request each time you call it. However, the Sass @import directive includes the file in the CSS; so no extra HTTP call is required at runtime!</p>

<code>@import "variables";
    @import "colors";
    @import "reset";</code>
<code>html,
    body,
    ul,
    ol {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
    }</code>

<!-- User Story #1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
User Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.
User Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java").
User Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).
User Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".
User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section.
User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.
User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.

User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query. -->
